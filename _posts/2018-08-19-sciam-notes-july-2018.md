### Smart Walls. *Prachi Patel*

Special paint turns a surface into a giant sensor.

Two functions:
- Sense human touch and track getures from a short distance (< 3 feet).
- Detect the locations of appliances and whether they are switched on.

This technology could someday turn on lights when a person enters a room, track a player's motion in an interactive video game or monitor a child's television use. 

Procedure: 
1. Cover the wall with a lattice of painter's tape and paint over it with nickel paint.
2. Remove the tape, leaving behind a diamond pattern of electrodes.
3. Connect the diamonds using thin copper tape, with a circular vinyl sticker in the middle of each electrode as an insulator. 
4. Wire the copper tape to a circuit board plugged into the wall and cover the wall with regular latex paint. 

The [paper](http://chrisharrison.net/projects/wallplusplus/wallplusplus.pdf) was presented at the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Montreal last April.

### Killer Infection: Is It Your Genes? *Claudia Wallis*

Subtle mutations can undermine our ability to fend off a specific bug.

This is an important idea, but I'm just surprised that the author is treating it as one that is novel: "Crazy as that sounds, there is a growing body of research that supports the idea."

### Crossing the Quantum Divide. *Tim Folger* 

Brief quantum mechanics review:
- Particles do not exist in definite states—here or there, having this energy or that—but rather take on all possible states and positions.
- Each particle is described with an equation called a wave function, which is a combination, or "superposition," of multiple waves. The amplitude of each peak in a wave function denotes the probability of a particle being found in any specific circumstance—for instance, at point A or B, as shown in Figure 1. 
- When researchers make a measurement of a particle, this act appears to reduce all the quantum possibilities to one, seemingly chosen at random. The measurement will find the particle at point A, for example, and the particle enters the classical realm, ceasing to be in a superposition. 

Quantum mechanics produces some bizarre effects in the microscopic world, but we do not see these phenomena in our macroscopic, “classical” reality. Why is that? Scientists have never understood why and how the universe crosses over between these realms, and no one has yet found experimental evidence to support any of the dozen or so theories that offer possible explanations to unify the two realms. 

Three such theories:
- **Collapse at Measurement.** Particles can linger in quantum superpositions as long as no one looks too closely, but once humans make a measurement, the particle is forced to “choose” a specific state.
- **Decoherence.** As long as a particle is undisturbed by any outside influence, it can remain in superposition, but when the wave functions of other particles or objects nearby meet with its own, they interfere, causing the particle’s many quantum possibilities to collapse into a single classical reality.
- **Continuous Spontaneous Localization.** The collapse of the wave function to a single possibility is a random event, not caused by human or environmental interference. The chances of any one particle collapsing at any given time are extremely small, but in macroscopic objects containing multitudes of atoms, the collapse of at least one is inevitable, which then causes the entire structure to collapse.

In recent years, physicists have started running exquisitely sensitive tabletop experiments that may one day reveal how objects make the startling transition from quantum to quotidian. Simon Gröblacher, for example, hopes to address an extraordinary question: Can a single macroscopic object be in two places at once? Could something the size of a pinhead, say, exist both here and there at the same time? Such experiments would reveal whether nature somehow censors quantum effects above a certain size scale. 

Miscellaneous notes:
- The gravitational wave detected by LIGO in February 2016 was a ripple in spacetime caused by two distant colliding black holes. The wave stretched and squeezed the space between two mirrors at the experiment's twin sites in Washington State and Louisiana, shifting the positions of the mirrors by just four-thousandths the diameter of a proton. 

### The Science of Anti-Science Thinking. *Douglas T. Kenrick, Adam B. Cohen, Steven L. Neuberg, and Robert B. Cialdini*

Scientific thinking often encounters ambivalent responses. Simply presenting a litany of facts is not enough. In fact, this approach can backfire because of humans' propensity to forgo rational decision making. Some key obstacles stand in the way of clear scientific thought:
- **Shortcuts.** Human brains are endowed with a facile means for dealing with information overload. When we are overwhelmed or are too short on time, we rely on simple heuristics, such as accepting the group consensus or trusting an expert.
- **Confirmation Bias.** Even with ample time and sufficient interest to move beyond shortcuts, we sometimes process information in a manner less like an impartial judge and more like a lawyer working for the mob. We show a natural tendency to pay attention to some findings over others and to reinterpret mixed evidence to fit with preexisting beliefs.
- **Social Goals.** Even if we surmount the first two obstacles, powerful forms of social motivation can interfere with an objective analysis of the facts at hand. Whether one is biased toward reaching one scientific conclusion versus another can be influenced by the desire to win status, to conform to the views of a social network or even to attract a mate. 

Even if the human mind has many obstacles to objective thinking, we shouldn't accept that ignorance and bias will always triumph. Social psychology suggests ways of coping:
- **Shortcuts.** When communicating complicated evidence, sufficient time is needed to switch from a heuristic to a systematic mode of thinking that allows for better overall evaluation. 
- **Confirmation Bias.** Change one's perspective, not by telling the person to remain objective, but by telling the person to consider what their opinion would have been if the evidence had contradicted their own views. 
- **Social Goals.** Explore whether agreement within the group really exists. Someone who disagrees with an erroneous opinion can sometimes open other group members' minds. 

There is a large literature on persuasion and social influence that could be quite useful to anyone attempting to communicate with a group holding beliefs that fly in the face of scientific evidence. 

Scientists need to adopt a more systematic approach in collecting their own data on the effectiveness of different strategies for confronting antiscientific thinking about particular issues. If scientists can incorporate the insights of research on psychological obstacles to objective thinking, more people will accept objective evidence of how the natural world functions.

### The Real Paleo Diet. *Peter S. Ungar*

What do you feed a 400-pound gorilla? Anything it wants. 

Paleontologists have traditionally assumed that the sizes and shapes of an animal's teeth dictate its diet. But food availability, competition, and personal preference are even bigger factors in what an animal chooses to eat. Often there is a mismatch between diet and morphology wherein organisms with specialized phenotypes may act primarily as generalist feeders in nature, a phenomenon termed Liem's paradox. 

For example, gorillas' teeth are designed for stems, leaves, and the pith of nonwoody plants, but gorillas have been observed to walk half a mile or more, right past edible leaves and stems, to get to a fruiting tree.

Tooth form can tell us something about what an animal in the past was capable of eating even if only once or twice in a generation, and the most challenging foods its ancestors had to contend with. But for insights into food choices among options that were available on the biospheric buffet, we need "foodprints," which are chemical signatures and microscopic wear patterns in fossil teeth that result from eating food.

Based on studies of foodprints on hominin teeth, researchers know that early hominin diets varied over time and space and we most likely evolved to be flexible eaters, driven by ever changing climates, habitats, and food availability. In other words, while it is good to eliminate processed food from our diet, there is no specific Paleolithic diet to follow. 

### The Clocks within Our Cells. *Veronique Greenwood*

Will we someday go into the doctor's office knowing the details of our own clock the way we know our blood type? Will we receive a customized time card for when to take our meds? 

It is estimated that up to 82 percent of mammalian genes are expressed in a cyclical pattern of highs and lows. This means there is a time aspect to biology. The implications for medicine are wide-ranging. Fifty-six of the 100 most commonly used drugs, including acetaminophen, target rhythmically expressed proteins, meaning the time of dosing matters. 

### Building a Weather-Smart Grid. *Peter Fairley*

Renewable energy (e.g. wind and solar power) will not become the major energy sources until a nationwide transmission grid (ideally direct-current rather than alternating-current) is designed based on local, daily weather variations.
