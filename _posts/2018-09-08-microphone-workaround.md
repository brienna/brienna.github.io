Accidentally ripped your microphone off your MacBook motherboard, like I just did? Or your microphone just not working? Don't worry. There's a workaround. You just need your iPhone, as well as taking these four steps:

1. On your iPhone, download Microphone Free by Von Bruno from the App Store.
2. Open the app and connect your iPhone to your MacBook via the Lightning cable.
3. On your MacBook, open Audio MIDI Setup. You should see your iPhone listed among the devices on the left side of the window. Select it and press the Enable button.

4. Still on your MacBook, go to System Preferences > Sound, then the Input tab. You should see your iPhone listed as a device to select for sound input. Select it.

You can now use the Microphone Free app on your phone as a microphone for your MacBook. Note that you'll have to repeat these steps every time you reconnect your phone.
